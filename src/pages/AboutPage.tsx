              Where Passion Meets Craftsmanship
            </h2>
            <p className="text-secondary-light mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Nati Jewelry was born from a lifelong passion for art and design. Our founder, Natalia, began creating jewelry in her small studio apartment, crafting pieces that reflected her unique aesthetic and attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p className="text-secondary-light mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              What started as a creative outlet quickly blossomed into a thriving business as friends, family, and then customers fell in love with her handcrafted creations. Today, Nati Jewelry continues to grow while maintaining the same dedication to quality and artistry that inspired its beginning.
